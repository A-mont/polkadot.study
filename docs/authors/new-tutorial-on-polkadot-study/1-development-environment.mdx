# Setup the Development Environment

Before you learn about the recommended style and structure of your polkadot.study tutorial, we will walk you through the process of 
creating a local environment that you can later use for submitting your tutorial to our website and for local preview.

## Forking the Repository

Polkadot.study uses the [fork-and-pull-model](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/about-collaborative-development-models#fork-and-pull-model). Meaning, that anyone can submit pull requests from their own forks of the repository.
The project maintainer, can then (after discussing, reviewing and revising) merge your changes to the main repository and make it part of the
website.

## Forking the repository
:::info
If you have never done pull requests, or worked with forks, read the [Github Docs Page](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) about it, to get you started
quickly.
:::

1. Go to the [polkadot.study github repository](https://github.com/PolkadotStudy/polkadot.study) and click the fork button at the top right.

1. **important**: uncheck the "Copy the `main` branch only" checkbox. You will need the `staging` branch in the next step.

1. Clone the forked repository to your machine in order to make changes. You can copy the **forked** repository address, by clicking the blue `Code` button and then
```
git clone <your forked repo url>
```

:::info 

If you get lost, or if anything is unclear, please contact [authors@polkadot.study](mailto:authors@polkadot.study) or [submit a github issue](https://github.com/PolkadotStudy/polkadot.study/issues).

## Running Locally
:::info

If you do not have `node.js` and `npm` on your machine, please follow [this guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).
:::

After you have forked and cloned the repository to your machine, to run it you need to install some dependencies.

```
# go to the directory you cloned into, e.g.
cd polkadot.study
# install dependencies
npm install
```

### Running the docusaurus development server
To start the docusaurus dev server, do
```
npm run start
```

Then, navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/). If you did everything correct, you should be able to find your tutorial in the tutorials tab at the very top.

The dev server supports hot module loading and will automatically update when you change and save your tutorial files.
