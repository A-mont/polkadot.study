# Local Development and Preview

Writing markdown is fast and easy, but there might be a time when you want to preview your tutorial. You can of course use plugins or services for that, 
but latest, when you want to preview your interactive quizzes and tasks, you might want a real preview
of how your tutorial that you have written until now looks in the polkadot.study environment.

## Running the local dev server

If you have not done that yet, fork [the polkadot.study website repository](https://github.com/PolkadotStudy/website) and then clone it to your machine.


### Install local dev dependencies
Then you want to install all npm dependencies by cding into the cloned directory and running
```
npm install
```

### Running the docusaurus development server
To start the docusaurus dev server, do
```
npm run start
```

Then, navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/). If you did everything correct, you should be able to find your tutorial in the tutorials tab at the very top.

The dev server supports hot module loading and will automatically update when you change and save your tutorial files.
