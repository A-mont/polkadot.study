# Submitting the Tutorial

Polkadot.study uses the [fork-and-pull-model](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/about-collaborative-development-models#fork-and-pull-model). Meaning, that anyone can submit pull requests from their own forks of the repository.
The project maintainer, can then (after discussing, reviewing and revising) merge your changes to the main repository and make it part of the
website.

## Forking the repository
:::info
If you have never done pull requests, or worked with forks, read the [Github Docs Page](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) about it, to get you started
quickly.
