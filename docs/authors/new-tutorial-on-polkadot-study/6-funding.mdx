# Receiving Funding for your Tutorial

Currently, as polkadot.study is being started. There is a safe funding for 10 tutorials. Read [this page](https://polkadot.study/about#looking-for-authors-march-2023) for the call and some more details.

## Future Outlook

In the future the plan is, that authors can get an easy way to apply for funding. The idea is to have a governance mechanism to 
select and secure funding for authors. How exactly this will be implemented is yet to decide. There could be a process in github,
where authors submit their ideas as issues and followers can reply and vote, or directly onchain or via bounties.
