title: Docs Contribution Guide
---
Thank you for your interest in adding to our knowledge base!

## Repo structure
The docs repository is structured intuitively with the staging branch as the default branch. Once you click on docs, you access a collection of .mds documents organized in folders the same way they are organized in the sidebar of the docs website.
- All the pages on Docusaurus are created from these mds

## Cheatsheet

We've created a simple cheatsheet file with examples of every heading, code block & tab component you can use to create your doc entry.

## Contribution steps:

**Step 1:**  Create a branch off of the staging branch

**Step 2:** Add your desired changes to your branch
- you can use yarn to visualize your edits of the docs locally.

**Step 3:** Make a PR to the staging branch
- once your PR is submitted, changes from your PR can be visualized thanks to Render
    - the render bot will comment a link on your PR others can use to look at the version of the staging-docs website with your PR implemented.

**Step 4:** Changes to staging branch (PRs) are reviewed and merged by *docs* admins
- after review, PRs are merged to the staging branch and your changes are now deployed live to the [staging docs website](https://docs-staging.flashbots.net/)

**Step 5:** Once enough changes have been collected/time is right, staging branch is merged into main branch by *docs* admins
- changes are now deployed live to [polkadot.study](https://polkadot.study/)
